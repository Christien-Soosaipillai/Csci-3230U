    		<p>illfield Strathallan College senior high school students ventured to the Florida Rowing Center from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada for an early start to spring training. With few expectations, without a doubt, we left better scullers. Through the on-water training, video review, and lecture sessions, our students were able to understand the "why" of sculling technique. Our students enjoyed every aspect of the camp. The coaches were friendly, approachable, and very knowledgeable. The whole atmosphere was relaxed and fun. The students raved about how much they learned and how much they enjoyed the entire experience. We would certainly recommend the Florida Rowing Center as a way to get your scullers to the next level.</p>

    		<p>Nancy and I want to thank you for the wonderful time we spent last February at the Florida Rowing Center. It exceeded expectations so much that we stayed for a full five days rowing there rather than the two we had planned</p>
